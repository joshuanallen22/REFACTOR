# REFRACTOR Program Charter

## Purpose
REFRACTOR delivers a production-ready sequence architecture that supersedes conventional Transformer
systems. The program integrates retrieval, mixture-of-experts routing, and persistent memory under
quantitative safety and telemetry guardrails.

## Scope
- Implement core model components spanning reframer, distinction engine, relation fabric, transformation
  core, memory, training, and serving systems.
- Provide governance, tooling, and operational processes so multidisciplinary teams can deliver features
  across seven implementation phases.

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Architecture meets performance targets defined in `specification/REFRACTOR_SPEC.md`.
- ✅ Telemetry, safety, and retrieval guardrails remain within SLA thresholds during pilot launches.
- ✅ All program phases exit with approved checklists archived in `outbox/`.

## Governance Structure
- **Executive Sponsors:** VP Research, VP Product.
- **Steering Committee:** Architecture lead, Infrastructure lead, Retrieval lead, Safety lead,
  Program manager.
- **Decision Forums:**
  - Weekly steering review for strategic adjustments.
  - Phase gates aligned to implementation plan milestones.
  - Risk triage council ad-hoc when severity ≥ high.

## Escalation Paths
1. Team lead attempts resolution within 1 business day.
2. Escalate to steering committee for arbitration.
3. Executive sponsors notified if resolution exceeds 3 business days or scope impacts safety/compliance.

## Communication Plan
- Daily async standup updates in shared workspace.
- Weekly synchronous standup across teams.
- Bi-weekly stakeholder readout summarizing metrics, risks, and next steps.

## Dependencies
Phase 0 has no external dependencies but seeds infrastructure for all later phases.
