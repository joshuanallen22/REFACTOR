## Milestone Timeline

- **Week 0.0–0.5:** Complete governance artifacts (0.1–0.4).
- **Week 0.5–1.0:** Bootstrap repository and tooling (0.5–0.8).
- **Week 1.0–1.5:** Establish telemetry heartbeat and SLA skeleton (0.9, 0.12).
- **Week 1.5–2.0:** Finalize backlog, risk register, and policies (0.10–0.15).

## Acceptance

Each WBS item requires documented evidence stored in `specification/` and sign-off from the accountable owner listed above.
