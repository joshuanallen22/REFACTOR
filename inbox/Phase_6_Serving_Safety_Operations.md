# Phase 6 — Serving, Safety, & Operations Checklist

| Field | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Timeline** | Weeks 24–28 |
| **Dependencies** | Phases 1–5 components validated |
| **Phase Gate** | Production readiness review |
| **Objective** | Prepare serving infrastructure, safety enforcement, and operational telemetry for deployment. |

## Workstreams & Tasks

### Serving Infrastructure
- [ ] Implement interactive, batch, and ultra-long serving modes with KV Cache++ integration.
- [ ] Build autoscaling configuration with load-shedding policies and warm pool strategy.
- [ ] Integrate model checkpoint loader supporting EMA snapshots and versioned router/retriever states.
- [ ] Configure observability for latency, throughput, and memory usage per deployment mode.

### Safety & Policy Enforcement
- [ ] Implement safety masks, constrained decoding, and tool/retrieval allow-lists within serving stack.
- [ ] Integrate real-time safety classifiers or guardrails for prompt/protocol misuse detection.
- [ ] Establish incident response workflow for safety breaches with kill-switch automation.
- [ ] Conduct adversarial prompt and retrieval poisoning tests with documented outcomes.

### Operations & SRE
- [ ] Build runbooks for deployment, rollback, and failover across regions.
- [ ] Configure alerting thresholds for latency, error rates, retrieval precision, router entropy, and memory health.
- [ ] Implement log/metric export to centralized observability platform with privacy filters.
- [ ] Define on-call rotation, escalation matrix, and maintenance windows.

### Documentation & Enablement
- [ ] Publish API documentation (REST + SDK samples) including tool/retrieval configuration guidance.
- [ ] Provide operations handbook covering dashboards, alert response, and routine maintenance.
- [ ] Deliver customer-facing SLAs and communication templates for incidents.

## Validation & Telemetry
- [ ] Load tests for interactive and batch modes meet latency and throughput targets.
- [ ] Chaos exercises validate failover, cache rebuild, and retrieval disablement procedures.
- [ ] Safety drills demonstrate kill-switch activation and policy rollback effectiveness.

## Exit Criteria
- [ ] Production readiness review approves serving stack, safety enforcement, and SRE coverage.
- [ ] Telemetry dashboards live with alert routing verified through dry runs.
- [ ] External documentation published and reviewed by legal/privacy stakeholders.
- [ ] Checklist archived to `outbox/` with links to runbooks, dashboards, and SLA documents.
