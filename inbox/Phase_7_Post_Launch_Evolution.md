# Phase 7 — Post-Launch Evolution & Versioning Checklist

**Timeline:** Weeks 28+  
**Dependencies:** Phases 0–6 completion and production launch  
**Objective:** Establish continuous improvement processes, versioned interfaces, and experimentation cadence for REFRACTOR.

## Versioning & Change Management
- [ ] Document semantic versioning policy for model checkpoints, retrieval index formats, and KV codecs.
- [ ] Implement automated compatibility checks ensuring decoders handle last two KV codec versions.
- [ ] Build migration tooling for retrieval index upgrades with rollback plans and validation suites.
- [ ] Establish change approval board reviewing representation and schema modifications.
- [ ] Maintain changelog and customer communication templates for version releases.

## Experimentation Framework
- [ ] Create experiment backlog capturing hypotheses (geometric heads, modality expansion, routing variants).
- [ ] Implement experiment orchestration templates with metrics, guardrails, and success criteria.
- [ ] Set up A/B testing infrastructure or offline evaluation harness for experiments.
- [ ] Ensure retrieval/tool precision targets enforced during experiments via automated monitoring.
- [ ] Capture experiment results repository with metadata (owners, dates, decisions).

## Telemetry & Guardrails
- [ ] Schedule monthly telemetry review meetings analyzing router entropy, retrieval precision, safety incidents, and latency trends.
- [ ] Implement automated alerts for SLA deviations persisting beyond agreed thresholds.
- [ ] Expand dashboards to include long-term trends and anomaly detection overlays.
- [ ] Verify privacy/PII policies remain compliant under evolving telemetry capture.

## Operations & Support
- [ ] Exercise change management workflow on at least one minor upgrade, documenting steps and outcomes.
- [ ] Update runbooks with lessons learned from post-launch incidents and experiments.
- [ ] Review support tickets and feedback loops to feed backlog prioritization.
- [ ] Train teams on version rollback procedures and communication protocols.

## Exit Criteria
- [ ] Baseline SLAs met continuously for one month with evidence stored alongside checklist.
- [ ] At least one version upgrade executed using defined change management process with postmortem published.
- [ ] Experimentation framework approved by research/product leadership and actively in use.
- [ ] Telemetry review cadence established with minutes recorded for two consecutive cycles.
- [ ] Checklist archived to `outbox/` with references to versioning docs, experiment logs, and SLA reports.
