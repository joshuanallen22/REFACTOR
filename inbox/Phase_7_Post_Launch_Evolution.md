# Phase 7 â€” Post-Launch Evolution & Continuous Improvement Checklist

| Field | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Timeline** | Weeks 28+ (continuous) |
| **Dependencies** | Production launch |
| **Phase Gate** | Quarterly roadmap review |
| **Objective** | Govern iterative improvements, telemetry-driven tuning, and roadmap planning after launch. |

## Workstreams & Tasks

### Post-Launch Operations
- [ ] Establish release cadence with semantic versioning and change-impact assessments.
- [ ] Maintain approvals log for router/retriever recalibrations and safety policy updates.
- [ ] Track SLA adherence and incident retrospectives with action item follow-up.

### Telemetry & Experimentation
- [ ] Implement experimentation framework for retrieval/router policy changes and feature flags.
- [ ] Monitor long-term trends in precision, latency, and safety metrics with automated anomaly detection.
- [ ] Schedule regular calibration of retriever similarity thresholds and router temperatures based on telemetry.

### Product & Roadmap Alignment
- [ ] Collect customer feedback loops informing schema/tool extensions and modality expansions.
- [ ] Update roadmap backlog with prioritized improvements tied to telemetry findings and customer requests.
- [ ] Align research experiments (e.g., new attention kernels) with production guardrails and evaluation plans.

### Governance & Documentation
- [ ] Run quarterly governance reviews covering risk posture, compliance updates, and roadmap adjustments.
- [ ] Maintain documentation versioning for APIs, configurations, and operational runbooks.
- [ ] Ensure inbox/outbox workflow continues with archived artifacts indexed for discoverability.

## Validation & Telemetry
- [ ] Quarterly health checks confirm KPI dashboards within target bands.
- [ ] Experiment reviews document hypothesis, guardrails, and decision outcomes.
- [ ] Audit logs verify policy changes followed approval workflow.

## Exit Criteria
- [ ] Continuous improvement loop operational with telemetry-driven prioritization.
- [ ] Governance forums active with documented decisions and action items.
- [ ] Backlog maintained with horizon scanning for next major architecture iteration.
- [ ] Checklist archived to `outbox/` each quarter with updated artifacts and summaries.
