| Field | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Timeline** | Weeks 18–24 |
| **Dependencies** | Phases 1–4 components integrated |
| **Phase Gate** | Training readiness review |
| **Objective** | Establish scalable training pipelines, optimization schedules, data curation, and auxiliary objectives. |

## Workstreams & Tasks

### Data Pipeline
- [ ] Finalize data deduplication, filtering, and domain mixing strategy with quality metrics.
- [ ] Implement curriculum scheduler ramping context length and retrieval/task injections.
- [ ] Build data provenance tracking with trust scoring and TTL policies.
- [ ] Integrate preference datasets and retrieval-labeled corpora for auxiliary losses.

### Optimization & Infrastructure
- [ ] Configure optimizer (AdamW/Adafactor) with warmup, cosine decay, and gradient clipping policies per spec.
- [ ] Stand up distributed training launchers (tensor, expert, pipeline parallel) with reproducibility controls.
- [ ] Implement activation checkpointing and mixed-precision flows with failover for overflow/NaN detection.
- [ ] Capture EMA weight management, snapshot cadence, and artifact promotion process.

### Auxiliary Objectives & Regularization
- [ ] Integrate retrieval contrastive loss, router load-balance, regret regularization, and safety conformance objectives.
- [ ] Tune loss weights with automated sweeps capturing validation metrics and convergence behavior.
- [ ] Build long-range synthetic task generation to stress >80% signal beyond local window.

### Telemetry & Monitoring
- [ ] Emit per-batch optimization metrics (loss, grad norm, LR, β1/β2 effective) to telemetry stack.
- [ ] Track attention entropy, router usage, retrieval precision, and memory compression metrics during training.
- [ ] Configure alerts for divergence indicators (entropy collapse, low precision@k, NaN spikes).

### Documentation & Runbooks
- [ ] Document training configuration templates, launch commands, and failure recovery procedures.
- [ ] Provide runbook for data pipeline incidents, including rollback steps for corrupted shards.
- [ ] Publish KPI dashboard definitions and acceptance targets for core metrics.

## Validation & Telemetry
- [ ] Dry-run training on subset verifying end-to-end pipeline, checkpointing, and telemetry integration.
- [ ] Conduct hyperparameter sweep to validate optimization stability and guardrail thresholds.
- [ ] Evaluate retrieval precision@k and router balance on validation tasks each epoch with automated reports.

## Exit Criteria
- [ ] Training pipeline approved by architecture, infra, and safety reviewers with documented sign-offs.
- [ ] KPI dashboards live with alerting configured and tested.
- [ ] Data governance artifacts (provenance, trust, privacy review) completed and archived.
- [ ] Checklist archived to `outbox/` with references to configs, dashboards, and runbooks.
