## Review Workflow
1. Owner uploads draft to shared documentation space and updates status to `Under Review`.
2. Stakeholders provide feedback within 2 business days; Program Director tracks via Jira board.
3. Upon consensus, owner updates version (e.g., `v1.0`), records approval date, and documents dispositions for key comments.
4. Finalized artifact moved from `inbox/` to `outbox/` with commit reference and Confluence link.
5. Any subsequent revisions reopen approval cycle with delta summary appended to change log.
